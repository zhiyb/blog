Finished advanced computer architecture exam.

Implemented a `TCPLinky` only controller host on [Noah NP1380](https://github.com/OpenNoah/OpenNoah.github.io/wiki/NP1380-Hardware) with Qt2 based GUI, just for fun. (Alternative implementation) Ref: [cdb62596a3e5f42a97a0473078176b272d620eb5](https://github.com/zhiyb/EE9-APRJ/commit/cdb62596a3e5f42a97a0473078176b272d620eb5)

With 50 fps refresh rate, it uses ~50% CPU time. It keeps constant target fps most of the time, drops frames very rarely, which is perfectly acceptable.

No more project meetings until May, due to Easter holiday.
